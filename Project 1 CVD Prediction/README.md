# Goals
<br>
<em>Dataset was provided by NTUC Learning Hub as part of the SCTP Data Analyst Course Capstone Project<br>
Additionally, this resembles the [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) on kaggle.</em>
<br><br>
With the sample dataset from Parkway Pantai, create a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as either **having** or **not having** heart disease.<br><br>
