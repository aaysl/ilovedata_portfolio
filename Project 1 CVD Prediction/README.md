# Goals
<br>
<em>Dataset was provided by NTUC Learning Hub as part of the SCTP Data Analyst Course Capstone Project<br>
Additionally, this resembles the [Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) on kaggle.</em>
<br><br>
With the sample dataset from Parkway Pantai, create a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as either **having** or **not having** heart disease.<br><br>

# Notebooks
In [`P1-1 EDA.ipynb`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaysl/portfolio_ay/main/Project%201%20CVD%20Prediction/P1-1%20EDA.ipynb), data set was analysed and cleaned using Python.
<br>
In [`P1-2 Modelling.ipynb`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaysl/portfolio_ay/main/Project%201%20CVD%20Prediction/P1-2%20Modelling.ipynb), using the cleaned dataset, relationship analysis was done with the different features of the dataset. Comparing different machine learning algorithms, the best was selected to make a prediction based on a test subset.
